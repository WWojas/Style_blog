From baggy suits, polished oxford shoes and those silly flat caps you can see in Peaky Blinders to skinny chinos, girly colours, knit ties brightly coloured jackets, sagging pants and chains and badass-like leather jackets. 

Over the last few decades, men's fashion has been a subject of a massive transformation.

New male style trends keep popping up from everywhere and with a more or less subtle help of bloggers and media celebrities unconsciously endorsing this new style of dressing they’ve started to become our new norm.


 
Which would be all fine and great by me if it wasn’t for the simple observation that’s been bothering me for quite some time now.

Namely, following most of this modern advice makes men look like idiots. 

Honestly, how can anyone wearing a pink jacket, tights chinos and white sneakers look like a normal man? Most people never stopped to think this through but wearing bright colours has always been a FEMALE mating strategy for attracting male attention.

Ever wondered why girls fancy wearing PINK tops, RED lipsticks or WHITE shorts so much? Yep, you can’t miss such vivid colours in the wild jungle of your typical urban city and that’s how females are attracting males. How can anyone expect to look manly wearing colors designed by the very nature for women?

And the funny thing about it is that most of them don’t even know about it, firmly believing they’re just keeping up with what’s fashionable these days ;).
 
Let me let you on a little secret here – blindly following fashions and trends can cost you a lot of your attraction.
 
<strong> “Attraction? Cost? Are you high, man?” – you may ask. </strong>

This is John (actually I’ve no idea what his name is, it’s a dude from stock images, so he might be Paul as well. Or Steven. Or Rick).
