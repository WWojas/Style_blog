Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So baboon this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
impassive fruitlessly shut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?

&lt;p&gt;From baggy suits, polished oxford shoes and those silly flat caps you can see in Peaky Blinders to skinny chinos, girly colours, knit ties brightly coloured jackets, sagging pants and chains and badass-like leather jackets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, men’s fashion has been a subject of a massive transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New male style trends keep popping up from everywhere and with a more or less subtle help of bloggers and media celebrities unconsciously endorsing this new style of dressing they’ve started to become our new norm.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which would be all fine and great by me if it wasn’t for the simple observation that’s been bothering me for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely, following most of this modern advice makes men look like idiots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, how can anyone wearing a pink jacket, tights chinos and white sneakers look like a normal man? Most people never stopped to think this through but wearing bright colours has always been a FEMALE mating strategy for attracting male attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered why girls fancy wearing PINK tops, RED lipsticks or WHITE shorts so much? Yep, you can’t miss such vivid colours in the wild jungle of your typical urban city and that’s how females are attracting males. How can anyone expect to look manly wearing colors designed by the very nature for women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the funny thing about it is that most of them don’t even know about it, firmly believing they’re just keeping up with what’s fashionable these days ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me let you on a little secret here – blindly following fashions and trends can cost you a lot of your attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; “Attraction? Cost? Are you high, man?” – you may ask. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly stating that I’m not going to answer any further questions without my lawyer allow me to present you with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is John (actually I’ve no idea what his name is, it’s a dude from stock images, so he might be Paul as well. Or Steven. Or Rick).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
